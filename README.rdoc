== Find Your Photog

Find Your Photog is a community of photographers where they can create galleries, upload their photos, give feedback to others photos, and share their contact information so that they can be discovered and contacted by those who are looking to hire a photographer. 

The site also harnesses 500px's API to display the 20 most popular images from their site, to complement the image database that Find Your Photog uses.

This site uses the Carrierwave and Fog gem to help upload the photo and create thumbnail versions of it.

Images are stored and called from AWS.
